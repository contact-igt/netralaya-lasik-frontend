A timely evaluation ensures your eyes are eligible, helps prevent dry-eye or night-glare issues, and leads to safer surgery with sharper visual outcomes.",

I came to Antardrishti Netralaya for a check-up and was advised LASIK. Honestly, I was nervous at first, but the procedure was completely painless; only eye drops were used, no injections at all. Within a few hours, my vision became clear, and I experienced just mild redness and watery eyes, which quickly settled. I’m really happy with the results and relieved to be free from glasses.",

After researching online, we consulted Dr. Tiwari, who explained everything clearly and gave me the best treatment option for my steep corneas. The surgery was completely painless, and the team made me feel comfortable despite my initial anxiety. Now I have perfect vision without dryness or discomfort—it feels amazing and truly life-changing.",
